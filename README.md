# FG-LiquID
This is code of our deep learning model proposed in IMWUT 2021 paper 《FG-LiquID: A Contact-less Fine-grained Liquid Identifier by Pushing the Limits of Millimeter-wave Sensing》
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478075


It works well in the environment with:

Python 3.6.9

PyTorch 1.1.0

scipy 1.4.1
